    "NumCS or Numerical Methods is widely used in todays research. From Physics, to simulation numerical evaluation is a vital task or sometimes even challenge.\n",
    "Math is nice and on paper everything (that can be solved) has a set of rules, that when followed correctly calculate the correct solution. Integrals, Derivatives, Interpolation are some examples of such computations. But Mathematical Numbers as we know them, are not equiavalent to the set of Machine Numbers. There are rounding errors that can occur either via cancellation or via overflow/underflow when operating with Machine Numbers. The goal of this lecture is to efficiently and correctly implement vital Mathematical Concepts in the world of Machine Numbers. The language of the implementetion is Python and common package used throughout is the numpy package. "
